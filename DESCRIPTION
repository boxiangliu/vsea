Description: VSEA estimates the enrichment of overlap between genetic variants 
            and genomic regions. It does this by selecting matched control 
            variants and estimate the odds ratio between the probability of 
            overlap between the foreground variants and genomic regions and that 
            of the background variants. To account for LD, VSEA selects LD 
            proxies based on 1000 Genomes phase 3 data. VSEA takes as input a 
            set of genetic variants, and a set of genomic regions. It outputs
            the enrichment, standard error of the enrichment, and enrichment 
            P-value.
